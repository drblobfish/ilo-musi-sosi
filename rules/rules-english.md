# sosi ?

*sosi* is a guessing game in which you can only describe your word using the words (called *nimi*) on the board.
If you know how to play the board game [concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_(board_game)), well, sosi is basically the same game with a different board and a twisted grammar system.

## Basics
- **Aim of the game:** Have the other players guess a word 
- **Number of players:** â©¾ 2
- **Winner:** The player that has the highest number of points
- **End of the game:** Game ends when the number of round that has been determined at the begining of the game is reached. In case of equality between two or more players, the game continues until one player has a higher number of points.

## Start of the game
Players decide to play as individual or in teams. The deck of card should be mixed and put next to the boardgame. The players need to determine the number of rounds that they want to play for a game. As an indication, a round takes between ... and ... min.

## Game progress
1. **Pick** a card and select a  **word** or a **sentence** on it
2.  Try to make it guess to the other players using the concept and subconcept pawns. Concept pawns (**color**) are related to main idea you want to use to make the players guess the word. Subconcept pawns (**color**) can be used as being related to a subidea of the initial concept.
3.  **Points** :
    -   The player that firsts **finds the word** gets one point
    -  The player that **makes people guess** gets one point
  

## Example of a round

1.  A player picks up a card and chooses the word *bicycle*
2.  The player chooses to place one pawn on *sike* and one on *tu*.
3.  Player that finds the word *bicycle* and player that made the other guessed both each earn a point.

## Additionnal infos and tips 
- Players can make as many proposals as they wish
- Players can put multiple pawns on one concept to give an indication on the number or to emphasize its importance
- The order in which you place your pawns can matter!
Feel free to rearrange the order in which the cubes appear
- If no one finds the word, the word is dropped and no one marks point at this round
- If the other players are lost, feel free to remove all or part of the cubes from the board and start over from the board and start again in a different way
